To run brute force and KMP on the different alphabets, simply run the respective class you'd like to test. In other words, there's no need to run Brute and KMP on their own.

The following classes with its purpose/description:

Alphabet: this is where we ran our tests for the standard "a-z" lower case letters
Binary: this is where we ran our tests for binary strings
Brute: a brute force algorithm for substring search with a counter
DnaSequence: this is where we ran our tests for "actg" DNA sequences 
KMP: the kmp algorithm for substring search with counters
Pi: this is where we ran our tests for the digits of pi
Worst: this is where we ran tests to check that our pattern/text pairs were indeed worst case scenarios for KMP

The following files are also included:

2^14pi: the digits of pi with a length of 2^14
2^15pi: the digits of pi with a length of 2^15
2^16pi: the digits of pi with a length of 2^16

The following Excel sheets are also included:

Binary: this is where we pasted our data using the Binary class, created graphs, and analyzed the binary strings
Digits of Pi: this is where we pasted our data using the Pi class, created graphs, and analyzed the digits of pi
DNA Sequence and Alphabet: this is where we pasted our data using the DnaSequence and Alphabet classes, created graphs, and analyzed the "actg" DNA sequences and the standard "a-z" lower case letters
