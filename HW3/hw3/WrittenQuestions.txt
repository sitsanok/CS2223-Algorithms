Q1. Do your empirical results support the proposition? Explain why or why not.

My empirical results do support the proposition since the proposition states that
sink-based heap construction uses fewer than 2N compares and fewer than N exchanges
to construct a heap from N items. Looking at the following sample results:

N          MaxComp          MaxExch
16	       26               13
32	       56               26
64	      117               56
128	      239              102
256	      484              205
512	      973              398

For example, when N = 16, 2*N = 32,
	the maximum number of compares found in 100 trials is 26, which is less than 32.
	the maximum number of exchanges found in 100 trials is 13, which is fewer than 16.

Similarly for the remaining N values, all of the maximum compares and maximum exchanges
satisfy the proposition.
